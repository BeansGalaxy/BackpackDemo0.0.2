# Backpack Demo V:0.0.2


A demo of my Backpack Mod. Designed to optimize inventory management and more.

## Backpacks
Works similar to bundles, but with much more storage. They can be worn on your back (<span style="color:brown">***TO DO***</span>) or be placed down to grab any Items that may have fallen to the bottom.

- Place your backpacks on walls for decoration or on the floor if you're in a hurry
- After you place, a right click lets you use your backpack like a chest <span style="color:brown">***TO DO***</span>
- If the mobs get the best of you your backpack will be okay, along with any items placed inside <span style="color:brown">***TO DO***</span>
